He was within a box; a box that vaguely resembled a room that had no windows and no air and only the piteous wailings of the woman next door, or was it himself?  Impassive, the great gray shapes of nothingness stared him in the eye, and he shivered with rage. The grand composition that he had planned for months and months, reduced to mockery! The brass, the timbals, the first crescendo of the violin - a passage of glory that was supposed to evoke the sublime brutality of the Gobi deserts and the dunes that dissolve into bone-white sand - dissolved, reduced to mockery!

And again the shapes came - the great gray shapes of nothingness.  They terrified him because they were unknown; he remembered when he was a child and was afraid of iridescent insects of which there was no name and every possibility of venom.  The great gray shapes had no tentacles, no pincers, no mouth.  Oh no, they were silent, and they did not permit his cries. No, they clutched at his throat and forced him to listen to the echoes of his own strangled, impotent sobs, silence.

The curtains rose, the musicians settled into their seats, the first scattered notes as they drew their bows and tested the pitch.  His heart pulsed with happiness; this was his day, he thought, the first time his new concerto would see light, and ah, after weeks of sleepless nights and fevered moments of pure inspiration flowing onto paper, how happy he was, how proud!  And then there came a shadow - the lithe little director, dressed in an immaculate suit with immaculate tie, ambling easily onto the stage and turning off the microphone. His movements were elegant, swift. He raised his hands slightly to the audience: only some last minute adjustments, ladies and gentlemen, nothing to fear, nothing of importance; thank you all, I take my leave now. And with the same easy grace he sprang off the stage.

But the composer himself could no longer breathe. His heart seized, he strained his ears, but there was only a soft murmur of violins. The crescendo!  He began to gasp, but the great room was silent.  He saw people shuffling in their seats, uneasy.  They looked at each other stupidly; they asked, what is this, who wrote this incomprehensible thing?

And again the silence returned.  And he endured, endured as his own visions were torn apart.  And then he heard the awful whirring in his ears, a whirring and clanging of gongs and cymbals that did not die down for three days and three nights.

Four days later the doctor told him: [Tinnitus](tinnitus).
