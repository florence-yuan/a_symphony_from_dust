title: 'The Composing Days'
---

When he was a young man, my grandfather played the violin; he played in front of the large windows that looked out at the grounds, warm dust floating at the rim of well-worn tracks.  The others were taking their morning run, and he was running his fingers over the violin strings while the notes ran themselves through the music he had composed in a hurry last night, ah!  Ethereal goddess that wakes at midnight, exactly midnight, and begins to shape her pliant flesh into something akin to glory.

What did the others understand about glory?  They trotted like a mismatched herd of the willing and the unwilling – the predator and prey jostled together until they were all but dispirited.  Now and then someone panted and faltered, and then someone else placed his hands on his knees and slowed into a trot.  Someone dragged their feet to make a staccato music of “tch-tch-tch” on the painted gravel and then the small, dark man who stood on the sidelines gave them a stern warning and a shrill blast of his large red whistle.

That damned whistle!  It cut into his music like a clap of thunder, but without a shred of awe or glory.  It was more like an overlarge fly that hovered with pendulous feet, slicing sharp diagonals now and then through the sinuous shapes of music.

He plucked the faded rose from the window sill and tossed it into the dust.  The little man blew his whistle again, and some straggler sped up, wheezing.  His bow had fallen sideways onto the chair.  He picked it up and dragged it across the strings, listening, hoping as the flow renewed itself.  The ethereal goddess returned from the dust, having accepted his offering.  He smiled wanly, his mind beginning to run in abstract circles.

"Have you always been like this?" I ask him, interrupting his reverie.

"Yes," he says, "[When I was a child...](grandfather_teens)"
