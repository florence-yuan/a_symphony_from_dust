When he was a child, my grandfather dreamed of the city.  Once he even caught a glimpse of it, when some posh band toured his village with a whole set of new contraptions and instruments and sounds he'd never even heard before, and everybody, even that surly, long-necked miser Old-Jo agreed that it was _something_.  Well, something was definitely _something_, but the something that caught his eye the most was an elegant instrument that could belt out the most wondrous tunes through a long bow scraping on four taut, shiny strings: the violin, he learned afterwards.

How would he know, at that time, that this was the beginning of a great, long [descent into complete and utter madness](/a_symphony_from_dust/pathways/grandfather_forties)?

No, he only knew his desire, the fact that he wanted, more than anything, to become a violinist.
