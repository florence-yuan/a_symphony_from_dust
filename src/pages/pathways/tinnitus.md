Tinnitus. noun Medicine: ringing or buzzing in the ears.

An ailment of the cochlea, an anomaly of bloodflow, an uneven blood pressure. That was what the doctor said. He was a doctor of renown, specializing in Western medicine.

He prescribed pills. The pills did not work.

The hallucinations began soon after. An old, rusty train roared through the fine hairs of his cochlea and the intricate vessels of his brain.  It kept him awake till his eyes were bloodshot and his teeth bared in animalistic grins. Oh, sure, he dreamed still, in that window of half an hour when the train finally roared away into unconsciousness. He dreamed of strangling the director with his bare hands, and it was very satisfying too when it lasted. Then he awoke to a new train with as much rust in its parts as an iron chest stuck at the bottom of the sea for three hundred years. That wasn't quite so fun.

He never went to see a doctor again, not a doctor who specialized in Western medicine, certainly. Oh no; he needed something else entirely, he decided, something that was much, much older than the disease that now plagued him, something that was the culmination of a wisdom more ancient than the flimsy little pills his doctor prescribed him...

And it all started [when he became a composer](/a_symphony_from_dust/pathways/grandfather_thirties).
