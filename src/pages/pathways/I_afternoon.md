It is three oâ€™clock in the afternoon, and a violin is playing. For a moment I wonder if it is my grandfather playing. After all, [he used to be a composer](/a_symphony_from_dust/pathways/grandfather_thirties).

Then I hear the usual noises from his room, the dull thuds of bottles and the occasional sharp clink. I can picture him now, hunched over beside the medicine shelf, his gnarled fingers reaching for different-colored bottles labeled in his own hand: 'yin', 'yang', 'relaxing', 'for tinnitus', 'for insomnia', etc. Many years ago, on the eve before a family trip, he emerged with the most ludicrously bloated suitcase, and it was only with a great deal of coaxing that he was persuaded to relinquish it, upon which the zipper promptly burst, and out fell what appeared to be his entire collection of medicine. With a great roar of rage he beheld the bottles on the floor, and fell to cradling them haphazardly into his arms with the air of a person who was inconsolable.

It was then that we all realized the truth, that his love for medicine superseded everything else. The hobby that at first made him read a few more quaint books and medical articles of questionable repute became a fiery passion, an all-consuming obsession.

After this catastrophe, it was with the most jealous care that he hoarded and guarded his medicine, a collection that has only grown since then. His violin, abandoned, lay in a case in a corner, forgotten and covered in dust.  What was music, when there was medicine?  What were a few notes that could soothe the soul, when there were infinite concoctions that should eventually, eventually, yield the key to healing the body?

And at night, there was no music at all.  There was only him and his old enemy, [tinnitus](/a_symphony_from_dust/pathways/tinnitus).
