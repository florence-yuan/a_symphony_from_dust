It is three oâ€™clock in the afternoon, and a violin is playing. For a moment I wonder if it is my grandfather playing. After all, [he used to be a composer](grandfather_thirties).

Then I hear the usual noises from his room, the dull thuds of bottles and the occasional sharp clink. I can picture him now, hunched over beside the medicine shelf, his gnarled fingers reaching for different-colored bottles labeled in his own hand: 'yin', 'yang', 'relaxing', 'for tinnitus', 'for insomnia', etc. Many years ago, on the eve before a family trip, he emerged with the most ludicrously bloated suitcase, and it was only with a great deal of coaxing that he was persuaded to relinquish it, upon which the zipper promptly burst, and out fell what appeared to be his entire collection of medicine. With a great roar of rage he beheld the bottles on the floor, and fell to collecting them into his arms. When a few slipped from his violently trembling hands and shattered, he began to groan and wail, and would allow no one to console him.

After this catastrophe, it was with the most jealous care that he hoarded and guarded his medicine, a collection that has only grown since then.

What was music, when there was medicine?  What were a few notes that could soothe the soul, when there were infinite concoctions that should eventually, eventually, yield the key to healing the body?

And at night, there was no music at all.  There was only him and his old enemy, [tinnitus](tinnitus).
